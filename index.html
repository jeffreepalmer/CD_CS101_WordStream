					<h1>PPC - Achieve More Efficient Pay-Per Click (PPC) Marketing</h1>
					<p><span class="bold">PPC</span> (<a href="#">pay-per click</a>) search marketing software offers a means for accomplishing two core requirements for PPC optimization:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="bold">PPC Automation</span> - While it would be impossible (and inadvisable!) to automate every aspect of <a href="#">pay-per-click advertising</a>, automating away redundant, time-consuming tasks affords you a means of increasing productivity. Often, this means being able to produce an amount of work that would otherwise have been unachievable for you and your business.</li>
						<li><span class="bold">PPC Management</span> - <a href="#">PPC management</a> refers to the maintenance and prioritization of <a href="#">paid search</a> marketing tasks.
